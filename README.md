## Short description of your project
Our project is quiz, where there will be a movie trailer displayed. Then you get a question of what the title of the movie is. 
If we have more time we will add different types of questions. Then if you answer fast enough on many questions. Your score get's 
displayed on the highscore leaderboard. This might change to more of a kahoot type of application where the highscore only exists for that specific game.
## What you have done
We have so far just set up the code skeleton of our project. We have managed to get data from an API and displayed that in the "gameView" which is the 
only screen working so far. We have also deployed our app.
## What you still plan to do
Well all of the other screens still need to be implemented and working. 

In the future if we have more time we will try to make it so you can play with your friends.
